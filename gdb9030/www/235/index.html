        Hi, my name is Gavin Blaylock and this is my personal site for IGME 235.
        I am a GDD (Game Design And Development) major currently (as of Fall 2022) in my second year.
        By the end of 235 I hope to be well equiped to create interactive websites and make web based video games.
        My time here at RIT has been very enjoyable, I've learned so much already and I'm looking forward to learn more about game development.
        When I graduate, I would love to be part of an independent studio. possibly one I help found, or work for one of my favorite companies like Rockstar Games or Ubisoft.
    </p>
