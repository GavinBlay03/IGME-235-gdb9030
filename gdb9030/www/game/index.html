    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. 
    <br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. 
    <br>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]
